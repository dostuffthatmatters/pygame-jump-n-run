## A Simple Jump and Run Game with Pygame

***Disclaimer:** I built this project as a sample solution
for a lecture I am supporting at my university. This lecture 
is audited by programming beginners and therefire the sample 
solutions should be rather easy to understand.*

*Hence, I did not use many libraries besides `pygame` itself 
and did not use the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism.*

*I will probably build more versions afterwards that use
these concepts (prime usecases: Movement, Collision 
Detection, Drawing).*

**Version 1:** Basic movement of (multiple players)

**Version 2:** Collision detection between Players and simple
Square-Block-Barriers



---

**Version 3:** Enemies with the same collision avoidance that
move life-like-randomly (here: Perlin Noise)



---

**Version 4:** Player-Player and Player-Enemy collisions
