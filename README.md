## A Simple Jump and Run Game with Pygame

***Disclaimer:** I built this project as a sample solution
for a lecture I am supporting at my university. This lecture 
is audited by programming beginners and therefire the sample 
solutions should be rather easy to understand.*

*Hence, I did not use many libraries besides `pygame` itself 
and did not use the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism.*

*I will probably build more versions afterwards that use
these concepts (prime usecases: Movement, Collision 
Detection, Drawing).*
