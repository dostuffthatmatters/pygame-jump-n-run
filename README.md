## A Simple Jump and Run Game with Pygame

***Disclaimer:** I built this project as a sample solution
for a lecture I am supporting at my university. This lecture 
is audited by programming beginners and therefore the sample 
solutions should be rather easy to understand.*

*Hence, I did not use many libraries besides `pygame` itself 
and did not use advanced concepts like inheritance or polymorphism.*

*Since the study program, I built this example for has been discontinued,
I will not continue to work on it and v7 can be ignored.*
